# Stellar Stories: Project Plan

This document outlines the project plan for the Stellar Stories application, a web app for exploring NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Goal

The primary goal of Stellar Stories is to provide an engaging and beautiful user experience for browsing the vast archive of NASA's APOD.

### 1.2. Target Audience

- Astronomy enthusiasts
- Educators and students
- Anyone with a casual interest in space and photography

## 2. Core Features (Implemented)

- **View APOD:** Display the image or video for any selected date, along with its title, date, and explanation.
- **Date Navigation:** Users can easily select a specific date using a calendar to view its corresponding APOD. The date range is limited from the start of the APOD archive (mid-1995) to the present day.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions:** A "Suggest" feature uses a Genkit AI flow to recommend a few dates known for having spectacular or interesting images.
- **"Surprise Me":** A button that fetches a random APOD from the archives, allowing for spontaneous discovery. This is also powered by a Genkit AI flow.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **High-Definition Link:** Users can click on an image to open the high-resolution version in a new tab.

## 3. Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (with App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with ShadCN/UI components
- **AI Integration:** Genkit for generative AI features (date suggestions)
- **API:** NASA APOD API

## 4. Future Enhancements (Potential Features)

- **Search Functionality:** Allow users to search the APOD archive by keywords found in titles or explanations.
- **User Favorites:** Implement a feature to allow users to save their favorite APODs to a personal collection.
- **Social Sharing:** Add buttons to easily share an APOD on social media platforms.
- **"On This Day" Feature:** Show a historical APOD from the same day in a previous year.
- **Enhanced AI Narratives:** Use a more advanced AI flow to generate a short, engaging story or additional context about the APOD being viewed.
- **Themed Collections:** Curate collections of APODs based on themes (e.g., "Galaxies," "Nebulae," "Mars Rover Photos").
